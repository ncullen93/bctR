# Clustering Code
# Uses "Matrix" package for fast matrix operations - similar to using numpy/scipy.

#' Weighted Undirected Clustering Coefficient
#' 
#' The weighted Und. clustering coefficient is the
#' average "intensity" of triangles around a node
#' 
#' @param W : a matrix - weighted undirected connection matrix
#' 
#' @return C : a vector - clustering coefficient vector
#'

  W <- Matrix::Matrix(W) # convert to fast matrix

#' Consensus of a Graph
#' 
#' This algorithm seeks a consensus partition of the agreement
#' matrix D. The algorithm used here is almost identical to the 
#' one introduced in Lancichinetti & Fortunato (2012): The agreement
#' matrix D is thresholded at a level TAU to remove any weak elements.
#' The resulting matrix is then partitioned REPS number of times using
#' the Louvain algorithm (in principle, any clustering algorithm that
#' can handle weighted matrices is a sutiable alternative to the Louvain
#' algorithm and can be subsituted in its place). This clustering
#' produces a set of partitions from which a new agreement is built. If
#' the partitions have not converged to a single representative partition,
#' the above process repeats itself, starting with the newly built
#' agreement matrix.
#' 
#' Note: In this implementation, the elements of the agreemenet matrix
#' must be converted into probabilities.
#' 
#' Note: This implementation is slightly different from the original
#' algorithm proposed by Lancichinetti & Fortunato. In its original
#' version, if the thresholding produces singleton communities, those
#' nodes are reconnected to the network. Here, we leave any singleton
#' communities disconnected.
#' 
#' @param D : a matrix - agreement matrix with entries between [0,1]
#' denoting the probability of finding node i in the same cluster as node j.
#' @param tau : a float - threshold which controls the resolution of the
#' reclustering
#' @param reps : an integer - number of times the clustering algorithm is
#' reapplied. Default value is 1000
#' 
#' @return ciu : a vector - the consensus partition
#'

                          tau,

#' Connected Components of an Undirected Graph
#' 
#' Returns the components of an undirected graph specified by the 
#' binary and undirected adjacency matrix 'A'. Components and their
#' constituent nodes are assigned the same index and stored in the
#' vector 'comp'. The vector 'comp.sizes' contains the number of
#' nodes belonging to each component. Furthermore, 'members' and
#' 'size' are combined into one list ' comp
#' 
#' Disconnected nodes will appear as components with a component
#' size of 1.
#' 
#' The identity of each component (i.e. its numerical value in the 
#' result) is not guaranteed to be identical to the value return in
#' other versions of BCT, although the component topology is.
#' 
#' In the Python-BCT, networkx is used to do the computation efficiently.
#' In the Matlab-BCT, the Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition is computed.
#' Here, we use the union-find algorithm
#' 
#' Note: Python version takes 1.8s w/out networkx and 54ms w/ networkx w/ sample.data
#' This R version clocks in at 20ms! 
#' 
#' @param A : a matrix - binary undirected adjacency matrix
#' 
#' @return comp : a list - each list element is a graph component, and
#' each component has two elements: 'members' - the vector of nodes belonging
#' to that component, and 'size' - the number of nodes in that component
#' 
#' 
get.components <- function(A){
  A <- binarize(A)
  n <- nrow(A)

    for (v in nbrs){
      idx1 <- Position(function(x) u %in% x, comps, nomatch=0) # findset(u)
      idx2 <- Position(function(x) v %in% x, comps, nomatch=0) # findset(v)

#' Weighted Undirected Transitivity
#' 
#' Transitivity is the ratio of 'triangles to triplets' in the network.
#' (A classical version of the clustering coefficient).

#' @param W : a matrix - weighted undirected connection matrix
#' 
#' @return t : an integer - transitivity scalar
#'

  W <- Matrix::Matrix(W)

  t <- sum(cyc3) / sum(K * (K-1))
