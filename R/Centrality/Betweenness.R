#' Weighted Graph Node Betweenness
#' 
#' Node betweenness is the fraction of all shortest
#' paths in the network that contain a given node. Nodes
#' with high values of betweenness centrality participate
#' in a large number of shortest paths.
#' 
#' The input matrix "G" must be a connection-length matrix,
#' typically obtained via a mapping from weight to length.
#' For instance, in a weighted correlation network, higher
#' correlations are more naturally interpreted as shorter
#' distances and the input matrix should consequently be
#' some inverse of the connectivity matrix.
#' 
#' Betweenness centrality may be normalized to the range [0,1]
#' as BC/[(N-1)(N-2)], where N is the number of nodes in the graph
#' 
#' @param L : a matrix - (un)directed weighted connection matrix
#' 
#' @return BC : a vector - node betweenness centrality vector
