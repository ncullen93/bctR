Brain Connectivity Toolbox in R

This is an effort to import the Brain Connectivity Toolbox to the R programming language. The package is currently under development and is maintained by N. Cullen of the Di2Ag Laboratory at Dartmouth College <ncullen.th@dartmouth.edu>. I warmly support any contributions - send me an email if you would like to collaborate.
