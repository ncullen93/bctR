Brain Connectivity Toolbox in R

This is an effort to import the Brain Connectivity Toolbox to the R programming language. The package is currently under development and is maintained by N. Cullen of the Di2Ag Laboratory at Dartmouth College <ncullen.th@dartmouth.edu>. I warmly support any contributions - send me an email if you would like to collaborate. 

I have decided to implement many of the functions in C++, then integrate them into R using Rcpp and Armadillo's optimized linear algebra library. My code is heavily based right now off the python version: https://github.com/aestrivex/bctpy.

Expected Date of Completion: March 1, 2016.
